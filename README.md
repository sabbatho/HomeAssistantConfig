# Welcome! :)
These are the [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration files that i use. I am not in any shape or form educated to do programming.
I do this for fun and to learn.
I have searched around in others repos and communitys so i feel it's only fair that i give back what i can. :)

# Hardware:
* __[Raspberry Pi3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)__ 
* Raspbee
* Aeon Labs Z-stick Gen5 USB-adapter
