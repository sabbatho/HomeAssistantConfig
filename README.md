# Welcome! :)
Began my journey with a Telldus and 433mhz switches. Found fast that i wanted to keep expanding so, i bought my first PI and started with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) late october 2018, using integration to Telldus and their z-wave and 433mhz unit.
Last of january 2019 i bought Raspbee and started tinkering with zigbee.
Soon after i changed to conbee at late of march 2019 to prepare for changing to a NUC or similar.
I found the PI working ok, it's slow though and the SD might be the reason for strange restarts and having to restart now and then because of freezes. So i prepared for the near future to change to something more long term.
So yeah, the wait was not loing, having an SD-card crash i instantly went to buy a NUC and have used it since 27th of august 2019. Started with installing Ubuntu server and Docker on the NUC to finally install hassio. Works pretty good :) I'm not very used to Linux so some trial and error.
Must add that i am sad i didn't change from my PI earlier, crazy how much faster the NUC is.
Then after a good while the method with using Ubuntu and docker got not supported. Was no issue until HACS stopped working because it was on an unsupported OS. So i reinstalled Home assistant OS and had to dedicate the NUC for Home Assistant.
Works very well to this day 2022-06-14 as i am adding text to this readme :)

So these are the [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) automation files that i have, only doing YAML-automations. I am not in any shape or form educated to do programming so i try with what i know and checking the forums.
I have searched around in others repos and communitys so i feel it's only fair that i give back what i can :)
